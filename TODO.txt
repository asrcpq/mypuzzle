Working:

- conditional compilation(no sound, no bot, etc.)
- mmbot build in build.rs/add build script

Planned:

- fix: misamino has several problems related to spawn rule difference
- better sound effects
- modify cc to run in a blocking way(for better profiling control)
- id
- write more tests
- read terminfo and support fallback mode: 16color, monochrome, ascii
- replay seek
- ui, stats during play
